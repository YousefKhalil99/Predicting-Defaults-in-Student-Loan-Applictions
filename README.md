# Predicting-Loan-Defaults-with-Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest-Classifier
In this project, we will implement a pre-prunned decision tree classifier as well as an ensemble random forest classifier to build a machine learning model that predicts loan defaults among student loan applicants. We will then compare the performance, interpretability, training time and generalisability of both models.
